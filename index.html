        <h1>Private Vs. Public Networks</h1>
        <p> The Internet is a vast place of knowledge, exploration, business, and much more. But to connect all of
            these, there are two types of Networks that must be put into consideration, Public and Private. Public is
            for any one and everyone to use while a private network is for only people with the password. Over the
            course of this essay, there are several aspects that will be discussed about both Public and Private
            networks, they are both different yet similar, both have downfalls yet pros, as well as best practices. </p>
        <p>First and foremost, it must be clarified as to what both Networks and their functionalities. A Virtual
            Private Network (VPN) is built over Public Networks in order to provide a higher quality. A private network
            could be a network in your home or in a school that only staff can use and etc. An example of a Public
            Network would be one used in a coffee shop or an Airport. A Private Network, however, would be found in
            homes, offices, etc. The two can be very different in some aspects. For example, a VPN has certain
            restriction so only a select few can enter and use it. On the other hand a public network can be accessed
            by anyone who has access to the Internet. Furthermore, the Public and Private Networks can be seen with
            similarities, as well as their own differences. An example being that both types of Networks use network
            intrusion. Network Intrusion provides a sense of security for networks. The main purpose for network
            intrusion is to detect unauthorized users, misuse, and or abuse of the network. Network intrusion detection
            systems, or NIDS for short, is an important part to keep a network secure and to prevent attacks. NIDS
            provide a layer of defense which monitors network traffic and sends an alert to the network administrator
            if there is an attack on their network.</p>
        <p>A public network is far from as safe as a private network. A public newtok in a hotel or coffee shops aren’t
            secure, even if they do have a password. You are still sharing a network with a vast amount of other
            people, and in turn your data could be shared and be at a higher risk of compromise. Some advantages of a
            public network include having decent speeds, which can go up to 7.2 Mbps (million bits per second) in 3G
            devices. On top of that, some public networks also have the upper hand. In a public network there is also
            timeshare connectivity which saves money because the owner of the public network is only paying for the
            time used. Economies of scale is also in place from a public network, which is a proportionate saving of
            costs that are gained by increased level of production. And finally, there are lower costs to operating a
            public network.
            A private network, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is far more secure, such as ones used in homes.
            Houses use a Private IP address, IP addresses like IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) which is the fourth
            version of internet protocol or IP. IPv4 is one of the core protocols that is used in the internet working
            methods. There is also another IP that can be used in a private network which is called IPv6. This version
            of internet protocol is the most recent version of the internet protocol and is intended to replace IPv4.
            Some advantages to a private network is that you have better control of the system or network that you are
            using privately. There is also the obvious one where it is more secure than a public network. A private
            network can also be more customizable due to the fact that it is privately owned. You have an increased
            control access so you can build extensive routers, backup power and additional sites, you can also repair
            the system when needed and enjoy better remote coverage with longer range across. A VPN allows you to
            create a more secure connection over another network on the internet. For example, on Windows, a VPN
            connection can use PPTP (Point To Point Tunneling Protocol) packets to enclose and send private network
            traffic. Such as TCP/IP or Transmission Connection Protocol/ Internet Protocol traffic over a public
            network like the internet. When it comes down to it, the use of a Private network over a Public network is
            highly more suggested for security and productivity advantages. By using cryptographic ( the practice and
            study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries ) and
            other security mechanisms, we can secure many random sequences relationships from breach, and from
            eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and
            completeness of the algorithmic specification.
            A public network does have many advantages to it, but unfortunately it has many disadvantages too. Coverage
            limitations is one of them, the coverage limit is the maximum amount of money an insurance company will pay
            for a covered loss. Coverage limitations is typically found to higher the coverage limit the higher the
            premium may be, limits can often apply to different types of coverage within a policy. The longevity of a
            public network isn’t so great, a lot of public networks stop working or need maintenance and if that isn’t
            attended to then the longevity of the network goes down. </p>
        <p>Private networks are obviously everyone's first choice, to own their own private customizable network. Some
            disadvantages though are isolation and maintenance costs. While the isolation of a private network
            guarantees increased security, it also makes it impossible for network IP addresses to go onto public
            networks to communicate with other computers. No information enters the network from other networks. So no
            email, outside data or digital software updates, and no information can leave the network onto other
            networks without being physically moved. In the context of a small business office on a private network,
            your employees could send data to each other but neither send nor receive data from clients, suppliers or
            vendors.</p>
        <p>While it may be frustrating to depend on far-away servers and service providers for network connectivity,
            the advantage of huge, global networks such as the Internet is that the cost of maintaining network
            fundamental facilities can be divided among millions of users. In the case of a private network, the cost
            of server space and connective equipment rests entirely on a single network operator. Private networks
            where one computer is connected to an external network can also require increased configuration and
            maintenance, because that computer has to use two IP addresses to communicate over the private network and
            with external networks.</p>
        <p>Both private and public networks use something called network intrusion. Network intrusion provides a sense
            of security for networks. The main purpose for network intrusion is to detect unauthorized users, misuse,
            and or abuse of the network. Network intrusion detection systems or NIDS are a very important part to keep
            a network secure and to prevent attacks. They provide a layer of defense which monitors network traffic and
            sends an alert to the network administrator.</p>
        <p>When it comes down to it, Public and Private Networks are extremely diverse in their own ways. However,
            while they both have their own characteristics, such as best practices and their own upcomings, aspects
            that enhance their usage, as well as disadvantages, they also share some qualities that make them alike. It
            is through Public and Private Networks that the internet truly runs off of. As time has passed, the
            internet has evolved, and what it has evolved into is much more than what anyone could have ever imagined,
            networks linking everyone and everything together. </p>
