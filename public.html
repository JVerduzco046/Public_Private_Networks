        <p>A public network is far from as safe as a private network. A public newtok in a hotel or coffee shops arenâ€™t
            secure, even if they do have a password. You are still sharing a network with a vast amount of other
            people, and in turn your data could be shared and be at a higher risk of compromise. However, despite that,
            there are still some advantages of a public network, this includes having decent speeds, which can go up to
            7.2 Mbps (million bits per second) in 3G devices. On top of that, some public networks also have the upper
            hand. In a public network there is also timeshare connectivity which saves money because the owner of the
            public network is only paying for the time used, which ultimately leaves lower costs to operating a public
            network. Economies of scale is also in place from a public network, which is a proportionate saving of
            costs that are gained by increased level of production. Furthermore, unlike Private Networks, which are
            generally restricted to one building, a Public Network can be far more widespread.
