            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You are able to inform potential members about your network, products or services without giving away all content and raise their interest</li>
                <li>If your visitors are interested in what you are offering they will have to become a member in order to read more</li>
                <li>You will achieve a higher membercount</li>
                <li>You can make your frontpage dynamic to attract more visitors and thus potential members/clients</li>
                <li>Search engines will notice your network and you might achieve a high ranking and thus reach more potential member</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to trigger potential clients to buy your products/services they can't see them without becoming a member first</li>
                <li>Content of your members will end up on the www and might not want this</li>
                <li>Again you are at high risk to be hit by spam and need to apply everything you can to fight this (member approval, captcha, etc.)</li>

    <h1>What is a Public Network?</h1>
                <p>
                        A public network is far from as safe as a private network. A public newtok in a hotel or coffee shops arenâ€™t secure, even if they do have a password. You are still sharing a network with a vast amount of other people, and in turn your data could be shared and be at a higher risk of compromise. However, despite that, there are still some advantages of a public network, this includes having decent speeds, which can go up to 7.2 Mbps (million bits per second) in 3G devices. On top of that,  some public networks also have the upper hand. In a public network there is also timeshare connectivity which saves money because the owner of the public network is only paying for the time used, which ultimately leaves lower costs to operating a public network.  Economies of scale is also in place from a public network, which is a proportionate saving of costs that are gained by increased level of production. Furthermore, unlike Private Networks, which are generally restricted to one building, a Public Network can be far more widespread. </p>
