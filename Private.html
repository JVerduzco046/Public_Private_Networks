                <li>No information enters the network from other networks. So no email, outside data or digital
                    software updates, and no information can leave the network onto other networks without being
                    physically moved. Example: In the context of a small business office on a private network, your
                    employees could send data to each other but neither send nor receive data from clients, suppliers
                    or vendors.</li>

    <h1>What is a Private Network?</h1>

    <p>A private network, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a far more secure network, such as a Network used
        in a home. These houses use a Private IP address, IP addresses like IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
        which is the fourth version of internet protocol or IP. IPv4 is one of the core protocols that is used in
        the internet working methods. There is also another IP that can be used in a private network which is
        called IPv6. This version of internet protocol is the most recent version of the internet protocol and is
        intended to replace IPv4. Some advantages to a private network is that you have better control of the
        system or network that you are using privately. There is also the obvious one where it is more secure than
        a public network. A private network can also be more customizable due to the fact that it is privately
        owned. You have an increased control access so you can build extensive routers, backup power and additional
        sites, you can also repair the system when needed and enjoy better remote coverage with longer range
        across. A VPN allows you to create a more secure connection over another network on the internet. For
        example, on Windows, a VPN connection can use PPTP (Point To Point Tunneling Protocol) packets to enclose
        and send private network traffic. Such as TCP/IP or Transmission Connection Protocol/ Internet Protocol
        traffic over a public network like the internet. When it comes down to it, the use of a Private network
        over a Public network is highly more suggested for security and productivity advantages. By using
        cryptographic ( the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third
        parties called adversaries ) and other security mechanisms, we can secure many random sequences
        relationships from breach, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to
        considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification.
